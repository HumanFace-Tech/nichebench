  After upgrading to Drupal 11 (which moves to PHPUnit 10), your BrowserTestBase HTML output
  is no longer written during test runs. You need to update your phpunit.xml configuration
  to work with the new PHPUnit version and Drupal 11's testing framework.
summary: Restoring HTML output logging for functional tests in PHPUnit 10.
question: What's the correct way in Drupal 11 to enable HTML output logging from BrowserTestBase?
choices:
  - A) Add printerClass="\Drupal\Tests\Listeners\HtmlOutputPrinter" to phpunit.xml like before.
  - B) Configure the HtmlOutputLogger under <extensions> in phpunit.xml and (optionally) set outputDirectory and verbose parameters.
  - C) Require symfony/phpunit-bridge and enable its listener via SYMFONY_PHPUNIT_REMOVE=0.
  - D) Run tests with --display-html-output so PHPUnit dumps pages automatically.
correct_choice: B
