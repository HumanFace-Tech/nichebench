  You maintain custom migrations. In Drupal 10 you called Migration::getMigrationDependencies(TRUE)
  to expand dependencies. In Drupal 11, that usage is deprecated and the $expand parameter
  has been removed. You need to update your code to use the new API.
summary: Updating migration dependency expansion for Drupal 11.
question: How should you handle migration dependency expansion in Drupal 11?
choices:
  - A) Keep calling getMigrationDependencies(TRUE); the deprecation is informational and safe to ignore.
  - B) Mark the migration service as public and inject the state service to recompute dependencies at runtime.
  - C) Replace migrations that declare dependencies with a Drush wrapper that serializes order manually.
  - D) Call getMigrationDependencies() with no $expand parameter and, when you need expansion, use MigrationPluginManager::expandPluginIds() instead.
correct_choice: D
