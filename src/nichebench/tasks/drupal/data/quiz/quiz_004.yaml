  Your CI pipeline runs core's JavaScript development tasks (npm/yarn) as part of module development.
  After moving to Drupal 11, Node 18 jobs start failing during core's JS build steps.
  This requirement affects development workflows but not production sites that don't install dev dependencies.
summary: Fixing JS build failures after upgrading to Drupal 11.
question: What's the correct fix when core's JS build fails on Node 18 after upgrading to Drupal 11?
choices:
  - A) Switch CI to Node.js 20 (LTS) wherever you install/run Drupal core's JS dev dependencies.
  - B) Add "engines":{} with "node":">=18" to package.json to relax engine checks.
  - C) Remove the npm step; Drupal 11 no longer needs Node for any development tasks.
  - D) Keep Node 18 but switch to Yarn 1, which bypasses the engine check.
correct_choice: A
